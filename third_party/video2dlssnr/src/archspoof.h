// archspoof.h — let the Neural Rendering model run on RTX 20/30/40.
//
// nvngx_dlssnr.dll 310.8 carries kernels for Turing, Ampere, Ada and Blackwell, but before it
// builds feature 18 it asks NvAPI for the GPU architecture and refuses anything below Blackwell
// ("DLSSNR: Unsupported GPU architecture"). The refusal is a policy check, not missing code.
//
// The model learns the architecture through NvAPI_GPU_GetArchInfo, resolved by id from
// nvapi64.dll's single export nvapi_QueryInterface. This module answers that one query itself,
// in this process only: the real answers for every GPU are cached first, the function's entry is
// then redirected to a handler that returns the cached data - with the architecture of a
// pre-Blackwell NVIDIA card reported as Blackwell when, and only when, the caller is
// nvngx_dlssnr.dll. Every other caller (the driver's NGX core, DLSS Super Resolution) gets the
// real card: told it was on Blackwell, DLSS SR takes the GPU down on Ampere. Nothing on disk
// changes, and on a card the model already accepts nothing is patched at all.
